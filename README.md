# image-captioning-keras
Converting the content of an image to text using cnn and transformer    I will be using the Flickr8K dataset for this project. This dataset comprises over 8,000 images, that are each paired with five different captions.  Example:    image,caption  - 1000268201_693b08cb0e.jpg,A child in a pink dress is climbing up a set of stairs in an entry way.
